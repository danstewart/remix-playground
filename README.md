## Remix Playground

Just playing around with [remix.run](https://remix.run).  


### Run

```bash
# Starts the application in dev mode and compiles the tailwind css
npm run dev

# Builds the production assets
npm run build
```

### Notes

##### Tailwind

Any `.css` files in `app/styles/*.css` are compiled to `app/styles/dist/tailwind.css`.
